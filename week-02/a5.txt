The commands 'google-chrome' and 'gimp' are already added in Ubuntu Linux. When you type them into the the terminal command line, they will open up the Google Chrome web browser and GIMP.
To add them as an alias in the .bashrc file, simply add:

alias google-chrome='path/to/google/chrome/executable'
alias gimp='path/to/gimp/executable'
