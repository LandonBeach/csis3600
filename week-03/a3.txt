I am currently running Ubuntu and not Cygwin. This is a basic file structure of the a Linux OS one level deep. Cywin will have a similar structure.
Here is a list of the common directories, their uses, and a graphical representation of it:

(TABLE)
Directory   Description
/bin        User binaries
/boot       Boot-up related files
/dev        Interface for system devices
/etc        System configuration files
/home       Base directory for user files
/lib        Critical software libraries
/opt        Third party software
/proc       System and running programs
/root       Home directory of root user
/sbin       System administrator binaries
/tmp        Temporary files
/usr        Less critical files
